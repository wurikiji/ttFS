* Samsung Exynos4 Audio Subsystem Clock Controller

The Exynos4 Audio Subsystem clock controller generates and supplies clocks
to Audio Subsystem block available in the Exynos4 SoCs. The clock binding
described here is applicable to all SoC's in the Exynos4 family.


Required Properties:

- comptible: should be one of the following.
  - "samsung,exynos4-audss-clock" - controller compatible with all Exynos4 SoCs.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

The following is the list of clocks generated by the controller. Each clock is
assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier to specify the
clock which they consume. Some of the clocks are available only on a particular
Exynos4 SoC and this is specified where applicable.


Provided clocks:

	Clock		ID	SoC (if specific)
	-----------------------------------------------

	mout_audss	0
	dout_rp		1
	dout_aud_bus	2
	mout_i2s	3
	dout_i2sclk0	4
	clk_i2s0	5
	clk_pcm0	6


Example 1: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.

	clock_audss: clock-controller@03810000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4-audss-clock";
		reg = <0x03810000 0x0C>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example 2: I2S controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
	   controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
	   about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

	i2s0: i2s@03830000 {
		compatible = "samsung,i2s-v5";
		reg = <0x03830000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&clock_audss 0>, <&clock_audss 3>, <&clock_audss 1>,
			<&clock_audss 2>, <&clock_audss 4>, <&clock_audss 2>;
		clock-names = "mout_audss", "mout_i2s", "dout_srp",
			"dout_bus", "dout_i2s", "i2s_opclk0";
	};
