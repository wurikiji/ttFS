Samsung Exynos4210 IOMMU H/W, System MMU (System Memory Management Unit)

Samsung's Exynos architecture contains System MMU that enables scattered
physical memory chunks visible as a contiguous region to DMA-capable peripheral
devices like MFC, FIMC, FIMD, GScaler, FIMC-IS and so forth.

System MMU is a sort of IOMMU and support identical translation table format to
ARMv7 translation tables with minimum set of page properties including access
permissions, shareability and security protection. In addition, System MMU has
another capabilities like L2 TLB or block-fetch buffers to minimize translation
latency.

A System MMU is dedicated to a single master peripheral device.  Thus, it is
important to specify the correct System MMU in the device node of its master
device. Whereas a System MMU is dedicated to a master device, the master device
may have more than one System MMU.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "samsung,exynos4210-sysmmu"
- reg: A tuple of base address and size of System MMU registers.
- interrupt-parent: The phandle of the interrupt controller of System MMU
- interrupts: A tuple of numbers that indicates the interrupt source.
- clock-names: Should be "sysmmu" if the System MMU is needed to gate its clock.
               Please refer to the following documents:
	       Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
	       Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/exynos4-clock.txt
	       Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/exynos5250-clock.txt
	       Optional "master" if the clock to the System MMU is gated by
	       another gate clock other than "sysmmu". The System MMU driver
	       sets "master" the parent of "sysmmu".
	       Exynos4 SoCs, there needs no "master" clocks.
	       Exynos5 SoCs, some System MMUs must have "master" clocks.
- clocks: Required if the System MMU is needed to gate its clock.
	  Please refer to the documents listed above.
- samsung,power-domain: Required if the System MMU is needed to gate its power.
	  Please refer to the following document:
	  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/exynos/power_domain.txt

Required properties for the master peripheral devices:
- iommu: phandles to the System MMUs of the device

Examples:
A System MMU is dedicated to a single master device.
	gsc_0:  gsc@0x13e00000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5-gsc";
		reg = <0x13e00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 85 0>;
		samsung,power-domain = <&pd_gsc>;
		clocks = <&clock 256>;
		clock-names = "gscl";
		iommu = <&sysmmu_gsc1>;
	};

	sysmmu_gsc0: sysmmu@13E80000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-sysmmu";
		reg = <0x13E80000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
		interrupt-names = "sysmmu-gsc0";
		interrupts = <2 0>;
		clock-names = "sysmmu", "master";
		clocks = <&clock 262>, <&clock 256>;
		samsung,power-domain = <&pd_gsc>;
		status = "ok";
	};

MFC has 2 System MMUs for each port that MFC is attached. Thus it seems natural
to define 2 System MMUs for each port of the MFC:

	mfc: codec@13400000 {
		compatible = "samsung,mfc-v5";
		reg = <0x13400000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 94 0>;
		samsung,power-domain = <&pd_mfc>;
		clocks = <&clock 170>, <&clock 273>;
		clock-names = "sclk_mfc", "mfc";
		status = "ok";
		iommu = <&sysmmu_mfc_l>, <&sysmmu_mfc_r>;
	};

	sysmmu_mfc_l: sysmmu@13620000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-sysmmu";
		reg = <0x13620000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
		interrupt-names = "sysmmu-mfc-l";
		interrupts = <5 5>;
		clock-names = "sysmmu";
		clocks = <&clock 274>;
		samsung,power-domain = <&pd_mfc>;
		status = "ok";
	};

	sysmmu_mfc_r: sysmmu@13630000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-sysmmu";
		reg = <0x13630000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
		interrupt-names = "sysmmu-mfc-r";
		interrupts = <5 6>;
		clock-names = "sysmmu";
		clocks = <&clock 275>;
		samsung,power-domain = <&pd_mfc>;
		status = "ok";
	};
