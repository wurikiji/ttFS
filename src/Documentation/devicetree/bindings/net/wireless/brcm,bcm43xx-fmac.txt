Broadcom BCM43xx-series FullMAC WLAN network adapter

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of following:
  - "brcm,bcm43143" - for BCM43134 chip,
  - "brcm,bcm4324" - for BCM4324 chip,
  - "brcm,bcm4329" - for BCM4329 chip,
  - "brcm,bcm4330" - for BCM4330 chip,
  - "brcm,bcm4334" - for BCM4334 chip,
  - "brcm,bcm4335" - for BCM4335 chip.
- wlan-supply: regulator used to control power of WLAN block of the chip.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: interrupt controller to which the out-of-bound interrupt
    signal of the chip (usually WL_HOST_WAKE pin) is connected.
- interrupts: interrupt specifier of the out-of-bound interrupt in format
    specific to interrupt controller specifiedy by interrupt-parent property.
- clock-names: Should contain one clock entry - "32khz", which is the external
    32768 Hz clock used by the chip.
- clocks: Clock specifiers given in the same order as specified in clock-names
    property.

Example:

	wlan_reg: voltage-regulator {
		compatible = "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name = "WL_REG_ON";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
		gpio = <&gpj0 0 0>;
		enable-active-high;
	};

	wlan {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm4334";
		wlan-supply = <&wlan_reg>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpx2>;
		interrupts = <5 4>;
		clocks = <&max77686 2>;
		clock-names = "32khz";
	};
